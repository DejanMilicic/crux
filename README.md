# Crux Demonstration Framework

Crux is an experimental starter project that is currently being used as a demonstrator for webinars and general architectural discussion.

Its core tech includes:-

- ReactJS Web Interface
- Dotnetcore API
- RavenDB Datastore

It is by no means a mainstream build as it uses extensive abstraction at both the Raven and React layers. As such its great for opening a discussion or looking at experimental techniques but it is in no way meant as a basis or guide for further development in production.

Crux will not be supported on an ongoing basis and is simply for demonstration and discussion purposes.

A live running version of this demostrator is available at https://clever-ritchie-902e7f.netlify.app/
